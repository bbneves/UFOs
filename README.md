#### Theme:
  The theme chosen was UFOs. Utilizing a dataset from 2010 and some extra info on expert the page was created.

#### Growth:

You may apply filters on top of filters to help narrow your search.

## Summary:
 The page is not complete yet, but the main part are assembled. On major drawback, is that the filter but be exact on the data information.
 
 THEREFORE, the important areas to further develop would be:
  
    - Flexible search to match more styles of writing. (Like date, abbreviations on states or not.)
    - Create a refresh search button, to be able to go back to the beginning. Without having to refresh the page.
